6. Do not close console, or copy results to any place.

  *It should look like:* 
  MN1 [IP address]:17151 masternodeprivkey [1K desposit transaction id. 'masternode outputs'] [1K desposit transaction index. 'masternode outputs']
   
  *For example:* 
  `MN1 192.168.1.1:17151 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0`

   - Private key: `93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg`
   - Transaction ID: `629dc27b721f57c97550868cac9f7e41049d12cce8ac344732b7f74a9fc81815`
   - Output index:  `0`

## 3. FAQ


1. How can I get my masternode rewards transfered to other address?
   - Enable coin control feature in your wallet (Settings => Options => Display => Display coin control feature)
   - Go to send tab
   - Press the button `Open Coin Control`
   - Select from the input list button only the inputs with amounts different of MN collateral (1000.00)
   - Click OK
   - You can send selected amount to any valid ALPB address.
   - Note: DO NOT EVER Transfer ALPB from that original 1k deposit or you'll break your Masternode.

2. I get the following error: "Could not allocate vin".
   - Make sure your wallet fully synced and UNLOCKED.

3. How many masternodes can I run using one IP/server?
   - The limit is only the memory. One masternode requires 150-300MB RAM. A server with 1GB memory can run 3 masternodes. Each AlpineBot MN requires own public IP, so you will need additional IP address(es) to run multiple ALPB MNs on same server.

4. I got stuck. Can you help me?
   - Try to get help from the community and remember to get help only in public channels. Look for our moderators first!
